-->you can easily convert a PublicKey object to its base58-encoded string representation     or its bytes array representation using the methods provided by the PublicKey class.
To convert a PublicKey object to its base58-encoded string representation, you can call the toBase58() method, like this:

const publicKey = new PublicKey('3pJzVdYgYpYkGjKZ8bh1KjDnQ2rJwVWtKzjKtuJX9QgM');
const publicKeyString = publicKey.toBase58();
console.log(publicKeyString); // outputs '3pJzVdYgYpYkGjKZ8bh1KjDnQ2rJwVWtKzjKtuJX9QgM'

To convert a PublicKey object to its bytes array representation, you can call the toBytes() method, like this:
const publicKey = new PublicKey('3pJzVdYgYpYkGjKZ8bh1KjDnQ2rJwVWtKzjKtuJX9QgM');
const publicKeyBytes = publicKey.toBytes();
console.log(publicKeyBytes); // outputs Uint8Array(32) [227, 161, 3, 211, 166, 5, 31, 164, 93, 196, 124, 10, 239, 225, 231, 238, 108, 110, 31, 197, 188, 235, 78, 84, 198, 238, 218, 55, 81, 60, 139, 87]

MINCONTEXTSLOT:
The minimum context slot number is calculated based on the contents of the block that's being verified. When a new block is created, it contains a set of transactions that need to be verified by the network. Each transaction in the block contains a reference to the "context" that was used to create it.

The context includes things like the accounts that were involved in the transaction, the previous block hash, and other metadata that's used to validate the transaction. When the block is processed, the Solana software looks at all the transactions in the block and identifies the earliest context slot number that was used by any of the transactions.

This earliest context slot number becomes the minimum context slot number for the block. Any validator that wants to verify the transactions in the block needs to have access to the state of the blockchain up to at least this minimum context slot number, in order to be able to validate the transactions properly.

So, in summary, the minimum context slot number is calculated based on the earliest context slot number used in the transactions in the block, and it ensures that validators have a complete view of the blockchain's state when verifying transactions.
